% Autolev macro extforce.a
% applies external force (SFx,SFy) and moment SM to a segment S
%
% extforce(S) 

% Define a point on S that coincides with the Ground origin
Points #1#GRF
P_GroundO_#1#GRF> = 0>
V2pts(Ground, #1#, #1#O, #1#GRF)				% compute its velocity, needed for equations of motion

% Define the external force and moment as variables SFx,SFy,SM in ground reference frame
Variables #1#Fx,#1#Fy,#1#Mz

% Apply the force and moment to the segment
Force(GroundO/#1#GRF, par__bodyweight*(#1#Fx*Ground1> + #1#Fy*Ground2>))
Torque(Ground/#1#, par__bodyweight*#1#Mz*Ground3>)
